          In the summer of 2019, at the age of 11, I found myself weighing close
          to 150 lbs and standing at 5'4", which classified me as overweight.
          Apart from playing video games with my friends and watching science
          videos, I had few hobbies. Like many kids, despite my parents' efforts
          to involve me in various sports, none of them resonated with me. I
          came to the conclusion that I was simply naturally inept at sports.

          With limited prior experience, I took up basketball upon a friend's
          suggestion, prompting my mother to enroll me in a team called
          Grassroots. Unbeknownst to us, Grassroots held a prominent rank in
          Ontario. The memory of that day lingers vividly, marked by the copious
          sweat that poured off me.

          It was an incredibly challenging and unpleasant experience that I
          truly despised, but I persevered. Despite consistently finishing last
          in every drill and sprint during the practice, I refused to quit.
          After the tryout, I found my mother speaking with the coach in his
          office. She later told me that the coach wanted me on the team because
          he had never seen such unwavering determination in a child who
          finished last in everything. That alone secured my spot.

          Since then, my journey has revolved around late nights and early
          mornings. Starting at the bottom as a practice player, I gradually
          climbed the ranks, enduring an ultramarathon. While my journey is
          still ongoing, in the '22/'23 season I've had the privilege of playing
          for a team consistently ranked top in the nation (as seen

          have surpassed the achievements of many in this sport. I am grateful
          for its impact on my physical well-being and the valuable life lessons
          it has taught me.
